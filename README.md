# Payroll Engine Backend
ðŸ‘‰ This application is part of the [Payroll Engine](https://github.com/Payroll-Engine/PayrollEngine/wiki).

## Open API
The Payroll Engine API supports the [Open API](https://www.openapis.org/) specification and describes the interface to the [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) tool. The document [REST Service Endpoints](https://github.com/Payroll-Engine/PayrollEngine/blob/main/Documents/PayrollRestServicesEndpoints.pdf) document describes the available endpoints.

> Payroll Engine [swagger.json](docs/swagger.json)

## API Versioning
In the first 1.0 release of the REST API, no version header is required in the HTTP request. For future version changes, the HTTP header **X-Version** with the version number must be present.

## API Content Type
The Payroll REST API supports HTTP requests in `JSON` format.

## Backend Server
To run the backend server, the web host must support the execution of .NET Core applications. For local development, [IIS Express](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/extensions/introduction-to-iis-express/iis-express-overview) serves as the host in two execution variants:
- [CLI dotnet command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet) using the command inside the binary folder:
```
start "" dotnet PayrollEngine.Backend.Server.dll --urls=https://localhost:44354/
```
- Visual Studio solution `PayrollEngine.Backend.sln` using the debugger.

## Application Settings
The server configuration file `appsetings.json` contains the following settings:

| Setting                    | Description                                              | Type       | Default        |

| `HiddenControllers`        | Name of hidden API controllers <sup>1) 2)</sup>          | string[]   | none           |

<sup>1)</sup> Wildcard support for `*` and `?`<br />
<sup>2)</sup> `HiddenControllers` setting cannot be combined with `VisibleControllers` setting

> It is recommended that you save the application settings within your local [User Secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets).

### Database connection string
The backed database connection string is determined by the following priority:

1. Environment variable `PayrollDatabaseConnection`.
2. Program configuration file `appsettings.json`.

## Application Logs
The backend server stores its logs in the application folder `logs`.

## Api Key
Once set, the API key is the only way to access the API endpoints. The API client must send it in the `Api-Key` request header.

The API key is defined in the following places (in order of priority):

1. Environment variable `PayrollApiKey`
2. Application settings file `appsettings.json`

When an endpoint request is made, the API key must be included in the `Api-Key` HTTP header.

> When the API key is active, Swagger requires authorization from it.

## C# Script Compiler
The business logic defined by the business in C# is compiled into binary files (assemblies) by the backend using [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn). This procedure has a positive effect on the runtime performance, so that even extensive calculations can be performed sufficiently quickly. At runtime, the backend keeps the assemblies in a cache. To optimize memory usage, unused assemblies are periodically deleted (application setting `AssemblyCacheTimeout`).

## Solution projects
The.NET Core application consists of the following projects:
